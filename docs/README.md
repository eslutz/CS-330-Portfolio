## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?

Working on this project, I developed some new design skills.  I had not done graphical work like this before, so it was an entirely new skill set to develop.  I now better understand how applying textures to objects work and how lighting works.  This will be helpful for any future work similar to this.  I approach designing software by first determining the requirements.  Part of my process, after determining the requirements, was to group related requirements together.  I ordered the work to complete based on which requirements depended on another requirement to be finished first.  From there I worked my way through the list, checking off tasks as they were completed.  I currently apply these same tactics with my work and will continue doing so in the future.

### How do I approach developing programs?

I did not use any new development strategies while working on my 3D scene.  My current strategy includes iteration, which allows me to improve upon my design by only making small changes at a time.  This allows me to try out different ideas to see what works and make improvements along the way.  Each milestone played an important part in setting the final project up with all the needed parts.  By working to understand what was being done in the milestone, it allowed me to easily apply that to the 3D scene.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The skills I have gained in computational graphics and visualization will help me through the rest of my educational pathway.  The use of iteration will help to ensure I develop the best program possible, without feeling overwhelmed by the scope of the work to be completed.  Additionally, this course required a lot of outside research to understand and implement all of the different concepts that were covered.  Knowing how to search and easily find the information I need is a vital skill to succeed and grow.  These same things can also be applied to my future professional pathway as well.
